# Patty, Nora Check-in 01MAY2024

## Date

Wednesday, May 1, 2024

## Attendees
- Nora Pearson
- Patty Burns

## Project Updates

### Sampling Progress
- 5 residential sites sampled so far:
  - Nic's house
  - Nora's mom's house
  - Nora's house
  - Jen's house (South Minneapolis)
  - Katrina's house (Marcy Holmes neighborhood)

### Permit Status
- New permits secured:
  - Three Rivers Parks (West Metro)
- Existing permits:
  - Fish and Wildlife Service (Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge)
  - South St. Paul
- Pending permits:
  - DNR (Scientific and Natural Areas, State Parks)
  - Ramsey County
  - City of Saint Paul

### Action Items:
- [ ] Nora: Discuss with Nic about reaching out to additional West Metro cities (Golden Valley, New Hope, Crystal, St. Louis Park)
- [ ] Nora: Follow up on pending permit requests

## Field Protocol Updates

### Pedon Description Form
Patty shared updates to Form 232 (pedon description form):

1. Added circling options for many fields
2. Expanded redoximorphic features and concentrations sections
3. Added artifacts page as optional third sheet
4. Included physiographic division information

Key discussion points:
- Artifacts page follows Red Book guidelines
- Circling options will help speed up field work and reduce errors
- Additional space for colors and textures in upper horizons

### Action Items:
- [ ] Patty: Send updated Form 232 to Nora
- [ ] Nora: Test updated form in the field and provide feedback
- [ ] Patty: Refine landscape/landform options for the Twin Cities area
- [ ] Nora: Consult with Nic about parent material options relevant to the project area

### Landscape, Landform, and Parent Material Classifications

Patty explained the interconnected nature of landscape, landform, and geomorphic component classifications:

1. Landscape (broad category, e.g., till plain, outwash plain)
2. Landform (specific feature within landscape, e.g., moraine, terrace)
3. 2D/3D Geomorphic Components (position on landform)

Key points:
- Region 10 has a simplified geomorphic guide that narrows down options
- Parent material classifications should be tailored to expected materials in the Twin Cities area

### Action Items:
- [ ] Patty: Locate or recreate Region 10 geomorphic guide for the team
- [ ] Patty: Develop simplified list of landscape/landform options for the project
- [ ] Nora: Consult with Nick to create list of expected parent materials

## Sampling Methodology

### Site Selection and Scheduling
- Aiming for 3-4 field days per week
- Multiple sites per day when possible, especially in parks
- Residential sites typically limited to one per day

### Gopher State One Call
- Calling for entire residential properties, but noting backyard focus
- For parks, Nora pre-flags sampling areas to limit locating work

### Action Items:
- [ ] Nora: Discuss with National Wildlife Refuge staff about potential "safe zones" for sampling without individual Gopher State One Call tickets

## Data Management & Analysis

### NASIS Database
- Discussed how field observations translate to NASIS data entry
- Emphasized importance of following Red Book guidelines to streamline data entry process

### Action Item:
- [ ] Nora: Ensure all team members are familiarizing themselves with Red Book while completing field forms

## Project Planning

### Kickoff Meeting
- Nora to draft agenda by end of day

### Action Items:
- [x] Nora: Draft kickoff meeting agenda and send to Patty and Joe
- [ ] Patty: Review draft agenda with Joe and provide feedback

## Detailed Discussion Notes

### Form 232 Updates

Patty walked through her updates to Form 232, highlighting the new artifacts page. Nora expressed enthusiasm for the updates.

### Landscape and Landform Classifications

Patty explained the hierarchical nature of landscape and landform classifications. She further elaborated on how these classifications relate to 2D and 3D geomorphic components:

Nora and Patty discussed landscapes, landforms, and parent materials that have been identified during field work thus far.

## Next Steps

1. Begin using updated Form 232 in the field
2. Continue sampling at secured sites (South St. Paul, Three Rivers Parks)
3. Follow up on pending permit requests
4. Develop simplified landscape/landform and parent material classification guides
5. Draft and distribute kickoff meeting agenda
