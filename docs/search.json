    "text": "Project Description\n[From Project Proposal] The purpose of this agreement, between the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and University of Minnesota (Recipient), is to harness existing collective resources, including non-NRCS research, data, specific expertise, and analytical capacity of soils in urban environments to complete a soil survey update. With much of the US population living in Urbanized Areas (UAs), there is a need for improved understanding of soil suitability’s, and limitations in these environments. Soil characterization information is needed in these areas as the resources are intensively managed, while current legacy soil survey products are largely out-of-date and provide limited use. Additionally, this agreement will promote the understanding the dynamic nature of soil properties in urban environments and expanding the use of new tools in support of urban agriculture.",

    "text": "3.4 Summary of Discussion\n\n3.4.1 Overview of DSP Guidelines\n\nNRCS is currently updating the DSP guide, expected to be published this year. The draft can be shared once it goes through public review in 4 months.\nGoal of a DSP project is to get DSP data on as much area as possible, focusing on the most extensive or important soils.\nRecommend 3 plots per condition (similar ecology/land management). Each plot has a main pedon and 2 satellites.\nFor intensive projects, use KSSL methods so data is comparable.\nIntensive projects require KSSL analysis. Intermediate projects use in-house lab. This project would likely be intensive given the UMN lab capacity.\n\n\n\n3.4.2 LA DSP Project Overview\n\nLooked at natural ground cover, artificial ground cover, and traditional lawns. Interested in climate resiliency, carbon storage, and gas fluxes.\nFocused on urban climate and social health. Examined techniques like xeroscaping.\nPartnered with Tree People organization to provide outreach on beneficial landscaping based on DSP data.\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Site Access Challenges and Solutions\n\nAccess can be a challenge. Partnering with local organizations that can help arrange access to sites is recommended.\nCan dig pits once to collect samples. Don’t need long-term access.\nRecommend taking photos, cores, and bulk samples if possible since access is limited.\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Study Design Discussion\n\nMost plots should be spread across the urban area, not concentrated on one site.\nFor urban agriculture focus, residential lawns could be reference state since that is common land use. Hoop houses and in-ground plots would be altered states.\n\nIf including non-urban reference site, look at uncultivated native sites outside urban area.\nDesign depends on goals - compare urban soils only or also compare to non-urban.\nNRCS flexible on study design within urban focus. Recommend consulting urban conservationists like Matt Lundberg.\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Analysis Methods\n\nRequired intensive tier uses KSSL methods. Can send samples to KSSL but may take 1-2 years to get data back.\nOptional intensive tier analyses like POXC could be done in UMN lab.\nInterest in testing additional indicators relevant to urban soils like contaminants.\nIf additional lab costs needed can discuss modifications to support more analyses.\n\n\n\n3.4.6 Related Research Opportunities\n\nIf other non-urban research needs identified later, NRCS may be able to do supplemental sampling through MLRA offices. Would share data to support publications.\nAllows sampling interesting uses like railyards if identified later.\nNeed to avoid overlap with this urban ag focus agreement.",

The group discussed balancing NRCS requirements for update surveys with the practical limitations of working in an urban environment. They talked through issues like site access, using non-traditional covariates for digital soil mapping, and the timeline for completing field work over two seasons. Action items included compiling sample density statistics from other urban surveys, continuing permit acquisition, and organizing an initial project kickoff meeting in March 2024. The next meeting will focus on the sampling plan with a smaller work group before bringing together all project partners.",

Much of the existing SSURGO data for the core urban areas of Minneapolis and St. Paul is very limited.\nThe project will involve field sampling, lab analysis, digital soil mapping, and development of products tailored for urban end users.\nThe project timeline is 2023-2025.\nA key early task is defining the project area boundary - the “contiguous census qualifying urbanized area within the Minneapolis, Saint Paul, Bloomington Metropolitan Statistical Area”.\nNora is working on analyzing land use, land cover, census, and other data layers to delineate this project area.\nThe project area will likely encompass Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the inner ring suburbs. It will be smaller than the full 7-county metro area.\nDefining the project area boundary will allow intersecting it with the existing SSURGO map units to identify the project map units.",

Samples will be archived and analyzed.\nMid-infrared spectroscopy will be used to predict soil properties. Lab data will verify and calibrate predictions.\nRasters, not vectors, will be the main mapping products. Rasters integrate well with the high-resolution LiDAR, land cover, and other metro geospatial data.\nThe NRCS will handle ingesting final raster products into their systems and creating certified SSURGO updates.\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Dynamic Soil Properties (DSP)\n\nA DSP investigation will occur in 2024-2025 at selected urban land use sites.\nThe DSP investigation will be “extensive” level - less intensive than a full DSM project.\nThe focus will likely be on variations across urban land uses, especially urban agriculture.\n2023 will involve planning and selecting sites for the eventual DSP component.\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Mapping Guide\n\nA documented mapping guide will be developed on conducting urban digital soil mapping and surveys.\nIt will build off an existing 2023 Urban Soil Survey Mapping Guide (NRCS Urban Focus Team 2023).\n\n\n\n7.4.4 Outreach\n\nCommunity engagement such as on-site soil screening will be conducted.\nNRCS staff will be invited to outreach events.\n\n\n\n7.4.5 Geophysical Tools\n\nTraining will be provided to NRCS on using field portable X-ray fluorescence for contaminant screening.\nThis will tie into the NRCS’s Site Assessment CEMA 207 protocol.",

This includes categories like single family residential, industrial, commercial, etc.\nNora downloaded the 2020 TIGER urban areas dataset for the whole US. She will need to clip this to just Minnesota and reproject it to match the coordinate system of the other layers.\nThey will ask Patty if she can generate a layer of just the Soil Survey map units that have urban components. This will require filtering the components table. If not, they can write code to do this filtering but it will take more time.\nThe goal is for Nora to have the TIGER dataset clipped and reprojected to show alongside the developed land use layer for Patty by tomorrow. Then they can discuss generating the relevant soil map units.",

    "text": "9.3 Agenda Items\n\n9.3.1 Update on Data Preparation\n\nNora shared her screen in QGIS to show the census urban area clusters data for the US reprojected into UTM zone 15N. She needs to clip this to just Minnesota.\nThe group looked at the generalized land use data. Nora extracted just the “developed” land use categories. This includes residential, commercial, industrial, etc.\nPatty had already clipped the TIGER census boundaries to a 7 or 10 county metro area. There is good alignment between the TIGER developed areas and the generalized land use developed areas.\nThe group discussed using the TIGER boundaries as a starting point to define the project area. They will remove the Stillwater area in Washington County and cut out Anoka County chunks that stretch beyond the core metro.\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Ideas for Defining Project Area\n\nPatty will pull SSURGO soil maps for the 7 county metro area and make a layer showing percent of map units that have “urban” in the component name. This will help identify the core urban areas.\nShe will also pull out Udorthents, as these are commonly used for urban soils but have no data.\nNic suggested also extracting floodplain components, gravel pits, and other “trash can” units that are opportunities for updating.\nNora asked whether well-mapped outer areas should still be updated. Nic said this could add value by updating soil data, but they will focus on the core urban area first.\nThe group looked at historical land use maps from 1945, 1984, and 2020. There has been a lot of development in the southern part of the metro. Nic noted the survey year ranges will influence what gets updated.\n\n\n\n9.3.3 Planning for Kickoff Meeting\n\nPatty relayed that the NRCS office needs a UMN presenter for the April 2 Fargo meeting. Nic will coordinate with Brent to determine who will present.\nPossible kickoff meeting dates are the week of May 6th or the last week of May. Patty will provide a few options from the NRCS side.\n\n\n\n9.3.4 Action Items\n\nNora will trim the urban area shapefile to the core metro area.\nPatty will create SSURGO map unit layers focused on urban, Udorthents, floodplain components, gravel pits, etc.\nNic will follow up on UMN presenter for Fargo kickoff meeting.\nPatty will provide date options for kickoff meeting.",

Review of Area of Interest (AOI) Boundary\n\nNic presented the draft AOI boundary, which was modified from the previous version:\n\nExcluded non-contiguous areas\nIncluded the Minnesota River valley within the urban area (southwest corner)\nExcluded the northwest corner\n\nPatty had shared the draft with Dan and Joe, who suggested excluding the Minnesota River valley as it may not be urbanized enough.\nDiscussions were held regarding the level of urbanization and potential impacts within the floodplain areas.\nPatty agreed to investigate the level of existing data coverage within the Minnesota River valley to inform the decision.\nArguments were made for including the floodplain areas, as they represent an urban river system with potential soil disturbances and impacts from urban activities.\nThe group leaned towards including the Minnesota River valley within the AOI, as it would capture an interesting aspect of the project and involve more potential partners (e.g., State Parks, National Wildlife Refuge).\nPatty will share the group’s rationale with Dan and Joe for further discussion.\n\n\n\n12.4.2 2. Presentation for Fargo Meeting in Early April\n\nNora will be giving a talk at the Fargo meeting, providing an overview of the project.\nNic and Nora discussed developing a draft presentation for Nora to share with Patty next week, to get feedback from an NRCS perspective.\nThe presentation will cover important aspects of the project, calibrated for the NRCS audience at the Fargo meeting.\n\n\n\n12.4.3 3. Permitting Process Update\n\nNora is working on obtaining permits from various entities, including DNR, Fish and Wildlife Service, Three Rivers Parks, and several cities (Maplewood, Roseville, Saint Paul).\nNora plans to create maps showing potential sampling points for each entity, to facilitate the permitting process.\nThe maps will be shared with Patty, as they will help in logistically planning and coordinating NRCS staff involvement.\n\n\n\n12.4.4 4. Sampling Strategy for the Current Year\n\nThe primary goal for the current year is to collect as much data as possible, rather than focusing extensively on residential areas, which can be more challenging.\nResidential sampling will be opportunistic and conducted in parallel with public land sampling.\nA dedicated team will conduct rapid response sampling at construction sites or upcoming construction sites, as opportunities arise.\nNic emphasized the importance of assessing and stratifying the sampling based on the data collected this season and the legacy data from previous years.\n\n\n\n12.4.5 5. Initial Field Review and Coordination\n\nPatty suggested an initial field review before the full-scale sampling begins, to calibrate data collection, sampling protocols, and rules.\nThe tentative timeline for the field review is June or early July, aligning with the NRCS field season.\nNora will be presenting at the Fargo meeting on Wednesday, and there was a discussion about potentially coordinating a smaller group meeting with key NRCS personnel (e.g., Dan, Joe, Albert Lea group) either before or after the Fargo meeting.\nPatty will coordinate with Dan, Joe, and others to determine the feasibility of a small group meeting during the Fargo meeting or scheduling a separate meeting before the kickoff meeting on May 28.\nThe goal is to gather input, concerns, and feedback from the NRCS partners before the kickoff meeting.",

Title and Authors\n\nThe title was set as “Implementing an Urban Soil Survey Framework in Minnesota” with Nora, Patty, Nic, Dan, and Joe as authors.\n\n\n\n13.4.2 2. Goals and Deliverables\nNora outlined the four main deliverables from the grant language:\n\nDSP project and soil survey\nDocumented mapping guide\nTechnical assistance and resources\nEngagement and outreach\n\n\n\n13.4.3 3. Area of Interest (AOI)\n\nThe AOI is based on census data for urban areas and urban clusters.\nNora mentioned that the shape file was created by Nic and trimmed to include only relevant areas.\n\nAction Item: Patty to smooth out the outer boundary of the AOI as requested by Joe and Dan.\n\n\n13.4.4 4. Artesol Incorporation\n\nNora highlighted that they will be incorporating artesol, which is being introduced as a new soil order.\nBoth Nora and Patty acknowledged their limited knowledge about artesol at this stage.\n\nAction Item: Nora to read more about artesol from the proposal document by John Galbraith.\n\n\n13.4.5 5. DSP Project\n\nNora mentioned that the DSP project will mainly happen in 2025.\nThis summer will be focused on collecting data and potentially scoping out sites.\n\n\n\n13.4.6 6. Methods Overview\nNora outlined the methods for the project:\n\nPublic land sampling (priority)\nOpportunistic soil sampling in residential areas\nCommercial areas sampling\n\n\n13.4.6.1 Public Land Sampling\n\nInvolves getting permits from DNR, Fish and Wildlife Service, counties, and cities.\nAims for access to large areas instead of individual properties.\n\n\n\n13.4.6.2 Residential Areas Sampling\n\nDescribed as an “opportunistic, flexible snowball sampling approach” by Nic.\nWill utilize existing connections from previous fieldwork.\n\n\n\n13.4.6.3 Commercial Areas Sampling\n\nWill involve a survey conducted by undergrads.\nThey will look for construction sites with open ground.\nThe team will reach out to construction teams for permission to sample.\n\nNora also mentioned the use of legacy data from previous projects, which includes lead, carbon, and phosphorus data from various sites across the Twin Cities.\n\n\n\n13.4.7 7. Timeline\nThe timeline discussion included:\n\nKickoff meeting\nField work starting this summer\nInitial field review\nDSP project in 2025\nData QA/QC and NASIS entry by September 2026\n\nAction Item: Patty to ask Joe for more details about the initial field review.\n\n\n13.4.8 8.

Sample codes will have a two digit year code and a three digit sample code. For example: 24-001. So, each site has a unique code and each sample has a unique code. Sample codes will be recorded on collection bags and on pedon description sheets.\n\n\n14.7.2 Action Items:\n\nNora: Develop spreadsheet or system for tracking pedon IDs across project\nPatty: Confirm sample numbering system with Dan Wing and KSSL requirements\n\n\n\n14.7.3 Landscape and Landform Classifications\nThe team discussed the importance of standardizing landscape and landform terminology:\nPatty: “Landscape is big like landscape might be tilt and and and it and it’s gonna be a like a really broad area of the landscape, but sometimes, like we’ve used… and all I can think of is like… till planes… and then your land form… And then land form might be I can’t even guess now.”\nThey agreed to develop a cheat sheet with standardized options for the project area.\n\n\n14.7.4 Action Items:\n\nPatty: Research existing landscape/landform classification guides for Region 10\nNora: Develop draft cheat sheet for landscape/landform classifications\nTeam: Review and refine landscape/landform options in next meeting\n\n\n\n14.7.5 Clay Percentage Estimation\nNora expressed concern about estimating clay percentages in the field.

    "text": "15.7 Detailed Discussion Notes\n\n15.7.1 Survey123 App Features and Benefits\nNic demonstrated the Survey123 app he’s been using for pedon descriptions; key benefits discussed: 1. Automatic geolocation 2. Photo integration (site, profile, field sheet) 3. Data backup/redundancy 4. Easy sharing with team members 5. Map interface to view all sampling locations\nThe team agreed to use Nic’s existing app rather than create a new one, as Nic has refined it over time.\n\n\n15.7.2 Form 232 (Pedon Description Form) Updates\nPatty walked through her updates to Form 232:\n\nAdded bedrock field back in\nExpanded diagnostic horizons section\nRemoved physiographic location (may add back in simplified form)\nAdded artifacts page as optional third sheet\n\nThe team discussed various aspects of the form, including:\n\nLand cover classification options\nSoil crust and cracks observations\nSurface water depth (flooded vs. ponded)\nVegetation description fields\n\n\n\n15.7.3 Urban Soil Classification Challenges\nThe team had an in-depth discussion about how to handle urban soils in relation to “natural” soil series. Key points:\n\nMany urban soils have fill or other anthropogenic materials overlying natural soils\nNeed to determine how to classify these modified soils\nMay use tax adjunct concept (e.g. “Lester tax adjunct”) for soils with urban modifications\nHeavily modified soils may need new classification approaches\n\nPatty explained: “So we have an artesol of a Lester? Lester is in your front yard, is now an artesol? Is it a tax adjunct? Do we still get to call it, like Lester tax adjunct and give Lester a new classification?”\nThe team acknowledged this is new territory that will require careful consideration.\n\n\n15.7.4 Digital Soil Mapping Approach\nPatty outlined a potential approach for digital soil mapping in urban areas:\n\nSample and classify soils at point locations\nUse modeling to predict soil properties across the landscape\nGroup similar soils into map units for vector-based products\n\nThis approach would allow for more detailed mapping while still producing traditional soil survey products.\n\n\n15.7.5 Sampling Strategy for Residential Sites\nThe team discussed how to approach sampling in residential areas, particularly when dealing with topographic variation within a single property. Patty suggested:\n“Usually when we go out and do DSMs, we’ll have 1 point like you’ll go. Your point was your backyard. Then we usually went upslope and down slope, and so to get a little bit more of that slope profile. What’s going on?”\nThis approach could provide more context for how soils change across the landscape, even within a single residential lot.\n\n\n15.7.6 Kickoff Meeting Planning\nThe team discussed preparations for the project kickoff meeting:\n\nDate has been selected (not specified in transcript)\nNora to draft agenda by end of week\nPotential presenters:\n\nRandy Riddle (urban DSM and soil survey)\nTroy Daniels",

    "text": "18.7 Detailed Discussion Notes\n\n18.7.1 Pedon Description Form Feedback\nNora provided specific feedback on the updated pedon description form:\n\nFront Page (Site-level Information):\n\nMuch clearer and easier to follow\nClear distinction between pre-filled sections and areas requiring input\n2D and 3D geomorphic component sections with circling options are particularly helpful\n\nBack Page (Horizon-specific Information):\n\nThree lines for matrix color are very useful\nGray shading helps differentiate horizons but can be difficult to read in bright sunlight\nRedox features and concentrations columns are greatly improved\n\nArtifacts Page:\n\nEasy to follow\nProvides ample space for descriptions\nCircling options for artifact characteristics (e.g., roundness, shape, cohesion) are helpful\n\n\n\n\n18.7.2 Potential Form Improvements\nThe team discussed possible additions to the form:\n\nNotes Column:\n\nConsidered adding a notes column for each horizon row\nDecided against it to maintain the current two-page layout\nWill use existing spaces (e.g., miscellaneous field notes, boundary column) for additional notes\n\nSample Number:\n\nDiscussed adding a dedicated space for sample numbers\nDecided to use the boundary column when not describing boundaries\nNora: “We use that yesterday to write the sample number. And that was perfect.”\n\nRoots and Pores Columns:\n\nDecided to keep the roots column despite auger disturbance\nPores column can be used for additional notes when not describing pores\n\n\n\n\n18.7.3 Box Folder Organization\nNora explained the changes made to the Box folder structure:\n\nPDFs and photos are now directly accessible without downloading\nIntended to streamline the review process for Patty and Joe\nGIS data (shapefiles, etc.) remain in zipped folders for easier transfer\n\nNora noted: “Hopefully that’s easier for you to use. Because you don’t have to constantly be downloading zipped files. You can just like click on a PDF or click on a photo and it loads it right in box without you downloading it to your computer.”\n\n\n18.7.4 Data Update Schedule\nNora committed to a regular update schedule for the Box folder:\n\nMinimum weekly updates, ideally more frequent\nCurrent on pedon description sheets, but behind on photo uploads\nWill aim to update photos to match the latest pedon descriptions\n\n\n\n18.7.5 Kickoff Meeting Preparations\nThe team briefly discussed the upcoming project kickoff meeting:\n\nScheduled for two weeks from the meeting date\nAgenda is mostly finalized, with some speaker assignments to be confirmed\nNora will update the agenda to include her name for relevant speaking parts\nPatty will check with Joe about who will give the DSP talk",
